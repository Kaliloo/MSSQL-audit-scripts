# MSSQL-audit-scripts

Scripts that can be used when auditing a MSSQL Server.
This script has currently been tested on MSSQL 2012 and MSSQL 2016.

Note: If you move a rapport it won't be able the find the CSS and JS files it needs. This will result in a less readable rapport. If you place rapports elsewhere make sure to update the necessary links. (1 CSS, 2 JS).
